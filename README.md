Morphological Disambiguation
============

Morphological disambiguation is the problem of selecting accurate morphological parse of a word given its possible parses. These parses are generated by a morphological analyzer. In morphologically rich languages like Turkish, the number of possible parses for a given word is generally more than one. Each parse is considered as a different interpretation of a single word. Each interpretation consists of a root word and sequence of inflectional and derivational suffixes. The following table illustrates different interpretations of the word ‘‘üzerine’’.

üzer+Noun+A3sg+P3sg+Dat  
üzer+Noun+A3sg+P2sg+Dat  
üz+Verb+Pos+Aor+^DB+Adj+Zero+^DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+P3sg+Dat  
üz+Verb+Pos+Aor+^DB+Adj+Zero+^DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+P2sg+Dat

As seen above, the first two parses share the same root but different suffix sequences. Similarly, the last two parses also share the same root, however sequence of morphemes are different. Given a parse such as

üz+Verb+Pos+Aor+^DB+Adj+Zero+^DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+P3sg+Dat

each item is separated by ‘‘+’’ is a morphological feature such as Pos or Aor. Inflectional groups are identified as sequence of morphological features separated by derivational boundaries ^DB. The sequence of inflectional groups forms the term tag. Root word plus tag is named as word form.  So, a word form is defined as follows:

IGroot+IG<sub>1</sub>+^DB+IG<sub>2</sub>+^DB+...+^DB+IG<sub>n</sub>

Then the morphological disambiguation problem can be defined as follows: For a given sentence represented by a sequence of words W = w<sub>1</sub><sup>n</sup> = w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub>, determine the sequence of parses T = t<sub>1</sub><sup>n</sup> = t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, ..., t<sub>n</sub>; where t<sub>i</sub> represents the correct parse of the word w<sub>i</sub>.

## Requirements

* [Python 3.7 or higher](#python)
* [Git](#git)

### Python 

To check if you have a compatible version of Python installed, use the following command:

   	python -V
    
You can find the latest version of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Git

Install the [latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Pip Install

	pip3 install NlpToolkit-MorphologicalDisambiguation

## Download Code

In order to work on code, create a fork from GitHub page. 
Use Git for cloning the code to your local or below line for Ubuntu:

	git clone <your-fork-git-link>

A directory called MorphologicalDisambiguation will be created. Or you can use below link for exploring the code:

	git clone https://github.com/starlangsoftware/TurkishMorphologicalDisambiguation-Py.git

## Open project with Pycharm IDE

Steps for opening the cloned project:

* Start IDE
* Select **File | Open** from main menu
* Choose `DataStructure-Py` file
* Select open as project option
* Couple of seconds, project will be downloaded.

## Creating MorphologicalDisambiguator 

MorphologicalDisambiguator provides Turkish morphological disambiguation. There are possible disambiguation techniques. Depending on the technique used, disambiguator can be instantiated as follows:

* Using `RootFirstDisambiguation`, the one that chooses only the root amongst the given analyses

        morphologicalDisambiguator = RootFirstDisambiguation()

* Using `RootWordStatisticsDisambiguation`, the one that chooses the root that is the most frequently used amongst the given analyses

        morphologicalDisambiguator = RootWordStatisticsDisambiguation()

* Using `LongestRootFirstDisambiguation`, the one that chooses the longest root among the given roots
        
        morphologicalDisambiguator = LongestRootFirstDisambiguation()

* Using `HmmDisambiguation`, the one that chooses using an Hmm-based algorithm
        
        morphologicalDisambiguator = HmmDisambiguation()

* Using `DummyDisambiguation`, the one that chooses a random one amongst the given analyses 
     
        morphologicalDisambiguator = DummyDisambiguation()
    

## Training MorphologicalDisambiguator

To train the disambiguator, an instance of `DisambiguationCorpus` object is needed. This can be instantiated and the disambiguator can be trained and saved as follows:

    corpus = DisambiguationCorpus("penn_treebank.txt")
    morphologicalDisambiguator.train(corpus)
    morphologicalDisambiguator.saveModel()
    
      
## Sentence Disambiguation

To disambiguate a sentence, a `FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer` instance is required. This can be created as below, further information can be found [here](https://github.com/starlangsoftware/MorphologicalAnalysis/blob/master/README.md#creating-fsmmorphologicalanalyzer).

    fsm = FsmMorphologicalAnalyzer()
    
A sentence can be disambiguated as follows: 
    
    sentence = Sentence("Yarın doktora gidecekler")
    fsmParseList = fsm.robustMorphologicalAnalysis(sentence)
    print("All parses\n")
    print("--------------------------\n")
    for i in range(len(fsmParseList)):
        print(fsmParseList[i])
    candidateParses = morphologicalDisambiguator.disambiguate(fsmParseList)
    print("Parses after disambiguation\n")
    print("--------------------------"\n)
    for i in range(candidateParses.size()):
        print(candidateParses.get(i) + "\n")

Output
